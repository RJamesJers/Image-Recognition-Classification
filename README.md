# Image Recognition Classification
Assignment 1 of my Practical Machine Learning module completed as part of my Masters in Business Analytics degree from Deakin University.

The Task was split into 3 sections:

### 1. Understand the Data
Tasks undertaken:

- Basic Data Exploration

- Create Test Train Split


### 2. Build Model to classify data
Tasks undertaken:

- Created a Scikit-Learn pipeline to explore data splitting prep including: 

--- PCA and Logistic Regression,     
--- Repeated Random Train-Split,     
--- K-Fold Cross Validation,     

- Evaluated performance of all techniques

- Explored what level of Dimension reduction is appropriate

### 3. Model Evaluation
Tasks undertaken:

- To find ideal performance compared 7 different models:

--- Log Regression     
--- LDA     
--- SVM     
--- Neural Networks     
--- Random Forest Classifier     
--- K-NN Classifier     
--- GaussianNB     

- Evaluated all Models Performances to find ideal Model

# Overall Findings

- Cross Validation significantly improved results
- The Ideal PCA number of dimensions was 110

### Best Model
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with ~80% Accuracy
