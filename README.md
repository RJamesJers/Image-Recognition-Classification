# Image Recognition Classification
Assignment 1 of my Practical Machine Learning module completed as part of my Masters in Business Analytics degree from Deakin University.

The Task was split into 3 sections:

1. Examine and Understand the Data

2. Build a Model to

3. Evaluate the Model to understand

### 1. Understand the Data
Tasks undertaken:

- Basixc Data Exploration

- Print Images

- Create Test Train Split


### 2. Build Model Tuition
Tasks undertaken:

- Created a Scikit-Learn pipeline to explore data splitting prep including: 

-- using PCA and Logistic Regression 
-- using ShuffleSplit
-- using K-Fold

- Evaluated performance of all techniques

- Explored what level of Dimension reduction is appropriate

### 3. Model Evaluation
Tasks undertaken:

- To find ideal performance compared 7 differnet models:

-- Log Regression
-- LDA
-- SVM
-- Neural Networks
-- Random Forest Classifier
-- K-NN Classifier
-- GaussianNB

- Evaluated all Models Performances to find ideal Model

# Overall Findings

- Cross Validation significantly improved results

### Best Model
- Logistic Regression
